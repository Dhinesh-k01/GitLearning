First i created a file without adding text or anything in that file and pushed that file directly into the GitHub and after that i added new text into that Modifying.txt file and again started the usual procedure to reflect the changes in local to github

1st step => git add Modifying.txt
2nd step => git commit -m "some messages"
3rd step => git push origin main
